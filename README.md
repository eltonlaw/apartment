# apartment

Crappy home automation

## Setup

### Phone


I used a spare Samsung Galaxy A5 I had lying around. Download a terminal emulator, [Termux](https://termux.com/) seems good and you can get it from the PlayStore,

Get a copy of this repo and install dependencies

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:eltonlaw/apartment.git
    $ pkg install make
    $ cd apartment/android
    ```

Get root access. Googling your model number should return some results. With Samsung it is a relatively simple process using Odin.
